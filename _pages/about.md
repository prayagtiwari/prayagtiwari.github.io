Hi! Iâ€™m Prayag, working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Aalto University, Finland.

My Research Interest
======
* Broad interests in machine learning, quantum physics, deep learning, reinforcement learning, cognitive science, medical informatics, IoT. I am interested in bridging the gap between these distinct fields.
* I have focused mainly on quantum-inspired models, such as quantum classification, quantum kernel methods, quantum-like structure for judgment, and decision making.
* Actively working for several NLP tasks (i.e., relation classification, knowledge graph reasoning, term mining, text matching, entity recognition, topic modelling,  learning word embedding, conversational sentiment analysis, sarcasm detection, etc.), and Computer Vision tasks (pedestrian attribute recognition, person re-identification).
* Actively working for applied ML/DL domain and especially in the medical domain (i.e., Term Mining in Biomedical Literature, Blindness Detection, Cancer Detection, Multimodal medical image fusion, Pneumonia detection, Depression scale estimation, Subtype blood-cells detection, ECG compression model, Covid-19 detection, etc).
* Interested in casualty, interpretability, and explainability of AI models.
