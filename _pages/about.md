Hi! Iâ€™m Prayag, working as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Researcher in [QUARTZ](http://www.quartz-itn.eu/about) project and Ph.D. student at the University of Padova, Italy. I received my Master Degree from National University of Science and Technology "MISiS", Moscow, Russia. 

My Research Interest
======

Broad interests in the areas of machine learning, specifically, developing ML models by using the theory of  Quantum Mechanics, and Cognitive Science/Signal Detection Theory. I have done several works in NLP (i.e., relation classification, knowledge graph reasoning, term mining, text matching, entity recognition, Conversational Sentiment Analysis, learning word embedding, etc.). I am interested for biases/fairness in ML and also to work in the applied ML domain(i.e., Medical, Transportation, etc).  Apart from this, my broad research interest is towards bridging the gap between several fields like QM, IoT, ML, Blockchain, Big Data, Deep Learning. I have several publications in top journal and conferences of Elsevier, Springer, IEEE, ACM, etc.
