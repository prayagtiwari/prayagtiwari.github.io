Hi! Iâ€™m Prayag, working as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Researcher in [QUARTZ](http://www.quartz-itn.eu/about) project and Ph.D. student at the University of Padova, Italy. I have been working mostly in the quantum inspired machine learning area for the last 3 years. 

My Research Interest
======
* Broad interests in machine learning areas, specifically, developing ML models by using the theory of Quantum Mechanics, Cognitive Science, and Signal Detection.
* I have focused mainly on quantum-inspired ML models, where I developed a quantum-inspired classification model and quantum kernel method. I also have been working towards quantum cognitive approaches for AI.
* I have been actively working for several NLP tasks (i.e., relation classification, knowledge graph reasoning, term mining, text matching, entity recognition, learning word embedding, conversational sentiment analysis, etc.).
* I have also been working for applied ML domain and especially in the medical field (i.e., Term Mining And Analysis in Biomedical Literature, Multimodal medical fusion algorithm, Brain MRI Image Classification, Blindness Detection, Pneumonia detection in Chest X-rays, Detection of subtype blood-cells, ECG compression model, etc.).
* Interested in Bias and Fairness in AI. 
* Interested in bridging the gap between several fields like QM, IoT, ML, Blockchain, Big Data, Deep Learning.
